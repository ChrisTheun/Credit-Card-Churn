								In this project I compare the predictive performance of various machine learning classifiers when it comes to predicting customer attrition for a bank's credit card services.
								The XGBoost algorithm outclassed all of the other selected classifiers and achieved an accuracy score of 97% and a recall score of 92%.
								Numeric features such as total transaction amount, the number of transactions, the total revolving balance, and the number of products held by the customer proved to be highly predictive of customer churn.
								In this post, I will go over the data exploration, data preprocessing, and modeling that were conducive to obtaining these results.
								The entire analysis is done in Python.
